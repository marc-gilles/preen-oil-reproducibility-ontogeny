### Overview of the repository content

* **`chemdata.csv`** contains the chemical (chromatographic) data of the preen oil samples.
* **`metadata.xlsx`** contains the metadata of the preen oil samples with descriptions of each variables.
* **`metadata_orig.xlsx`** contains the metadata of the preen oil samples from Gilles et al. (2024) (original study).
